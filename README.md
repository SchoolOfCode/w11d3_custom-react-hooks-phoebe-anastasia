# Custom Hooks

Custom hooks allow you keep your components clean by extracting the logic needed for a task into one function you can then consume in your component. That logic can also then be reused across many components.

⚠️ For each hook you write, remember to write your plan first. While planning, discuss the following:
- Take a look at the component(s) and figure out what all the code in them is doing as written first. Once you can articulate what's happening, then decide what logic you can pull out into a custom hook. (What is unique to that component? What isn't?)
- What does your hook needs to take in as parameters, if any?
- Plan out the logic in the hook itself, breaking it down as usual. Do you need to use existing React hooks within your custom hooks?
- What does your hook need to return at the end, if anything? What does the component need to see/use out of the hook?

## Task 1:

👉 1.1: In `src/hooks/useDocumentTitle.js`, create a custom `useDocumentTitle` hook that takes in a title and changes the document's title accordingly. Use this hook in the `BasicCounter` and the `SheepCounter` components so that the document title updates when the counter does with the number.

👉 1.2: Extract the common logic in the `BasicCounter` and the `SheepCounter` components into a custom hook called `useCounter`. Write your hook in `src/hooks/useCounter.js` and import it into each component.

## Task 2:

👉 Tidy up the `ControlledInput` component by writing a custom hook called `usePersistentState`. Write your hook in `src/hooks/usePersistentState.js` and import it into the component.

## Task 3:

👉 Extract the common logic in the `PokemonViewer` and the `DadJoke` components into a custom hook called `useFetch`. Write your hook in `src/hooks/useFetch.js` and import it into each component.

## Bonus:

⭐ Are there any other features you can think of to add via custom hooks to these components? Try some out!

⭐ Write a custom hook that can add any event listener to the window and calls a callback with the event object. Have it clean up after itself by returning a function from the useEffect callback!
